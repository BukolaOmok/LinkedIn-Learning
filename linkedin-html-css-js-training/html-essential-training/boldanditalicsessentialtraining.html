    <p>My <em>favorite</em> character from <i>Sesame Street</i> is Grover.</p>

    <h1><strong>WARNING!</strong> Do not be late.</h1>
    
    <H2><strong>CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE</strong> and other things I crave</H2>

   <p>This is a paragraph of text. Let’s pretend it’s part of a long article, where we expect many people to quickly scan
    through it, and <b>we want to mark certain phrases with some boldness,</b> some visual attention, so that those sentences jump
    out and people don’t miss them. Almost like having a pull-quote.</p>
